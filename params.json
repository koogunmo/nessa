{"name":"Nessa","tagline":"Automated TV torrent downloader and file manager","body":"# NodeTV\r\nAutomated TV Torrenting acquisition\r\n\r\n## Project Goal\r\n\r\n\"Build a system that functions in a similar manner to SickBeard, but using torrents only.\"\r\n\r\nI tried [SickBeard](http://sickbeard.com/), but it wouldn't easily let me arrange/name my files in a way I liked. It was also heavily skewed towards using newsgroups, which I don't use, thus NodeTV was born.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\n- Compatible operating systems\r\n\t- Linux: Tested on Ubuntu\r\n\t- OS X: 10.6 or later\r\n\t- Windows users: You're on your own for now\r\n\t\t- Please see the note at the bottom of this document\r\n- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) 0.10.x\r\n- [MongoDB](http://mongodb.org) 2.4.x\r\n- [Transmission](http://transmissionbt.com) with RPC Enabled\r\n- A free [Trakt](http://trakt.tv) account\r\n\r\n\r\n## Optional Third-party software\r\nNodeTV doesn't handle uPNP/DLNA (yet), so if you want to stream your content, you'll need a MediaServer. I've used the following, with various degrees of success\r\n\r\n\r\n[ReadyMedia](minidlna.sourceforge.net) - ** Recommended **  \r\nA simple uPNP/DLNA compatible MediaServer (Open Source)  \r\n[Twonky 7](http://twonky.com/downloads)  \r\nCommercial uPNP/DLNA server with companion app for mobile devices\r\n  \r\nThese work reasonably well with VLC and my XBOX 360. Your mileage may vary.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Browser Support\r\n\r\nNodeTV works in all current browsers. IE 8.0 and earlier are not supported.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installing\r\n\r\nClone the repository\r\n> git clone https://github.com/greebowarrior/nessa.git /opt/nodetv\r\n\r\nNext, you'll need to install the dependencies\r\n> npm install\r\n\r\n\r\n## Running NodeTV\r\n\r\nOn the command line, run the following\r\n> /usr/bin/node /path/to/nodetv/server.js\r\n\r\nYou'll probably want to daemonize the process, I use [forever](https://github.com/nodejitsu/forever) combined with an upstart script.  \r\nIf anyone can convert it to systemd, I would be very grateful.\r\n\r\nYou can then access the interface at [http://localhost:6377](http://localhost:6377)  \r\n\r\n### Ubuntu\r\nAn upstart job can be found at scripts/upstart.conf\r\n> sudo cp scripts/upstart.conf /etc/init/nodetv.conf  \r\n> sudo initctl reload-configuration\r\n\r\n\r\n## File formatting\r\n\r\nWe use a human-readable format for directories and filenames.\r\n>[Show Name]/Season ##/Episode ## - [Show Title].ext\r\n\r\nSeason and Episode numbers always have leading zeroes.\r\n\r\nIn the case of multipart episodes, the format is expanded:\r\n> [Show Name]/Season ##/Episode ##-## - [Part 1 Title; Part 2 Title].ext\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n> Falling Skies/Season 01/Episode 01-02 - Live and Learn; The Armory.avi\r\n\r\nWe chose this format due to it's tidy structure, ease of navigation, and legibility. We may, in future, add the ability to customise this on a global and per-show basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n## RegExp\r\n\r\nWe use the following Regular Expressions to detect the Season/Episode numbers in the filenames.\r\nWe welcome any improvements you can suggest!\r\n\r\n### Episodic content\r\n\t\r\n\t(?:S|Season)?\\s?(\\d{1,2})(?:[\\w\\s\\-\\:]+)?[\\/\\s]?(?:E|Episode|x)?\\s?([\\d]{2,})(?:(?:E|-)\\s?([\\d]{2,})){0,}\r\n\r\nWhich supports the following structures:\r\n\t\r\n\tSeason 01/Episode 02\r\n\tSeason 01/Episode 02\r\n\tSeason 01/Episode 02-03\r\n\tS01E02\r\n\tS01E02-03\r\n\tS01E02E03\r\n\t1x02\r\n\t1x02-03\r\n\r\nIt also supports episode spans of any size. For example, it would handle a file that contains Episodes 1 through 12, although it's unlikely that such a file would ever be released.\t\r\n\r\nOptionally, the Season name may have subtitle:\r\n\t\r\n\tAmerican Horror Story/Season 02: Asylum/Episode 01 - Welcome to Briarcliff.mp4\r\n\tAmerican Horror Story/Season 02 - Asylum/Episode 01 - Welcome to Briarcliff.mp4\r\n\r\nAny episodes which are similar to:\t\r\n\r\n\t102\r\n\t10203\r\n\t\r\nare ignored because that format is unbelievably stupid. Sorry folks, but you'll have to rename them yourselves.\r\n\r\n### Daily Shows/Air-by-date\r\n\r\nShows that are aired daily (e.g The Colbert Report, The Daily Show, Conan) don't have season or episode numbers in the conventional sense.\r\n\t\r\n\t(\\d{4})\\D?(\\d{2})\\D?(\\d{2})\r\nWhich will match:\r\n\t\r\n\t2013.08.01\r\n\t20130801\r\n\t\r\nwith any separator in place of the dot.\r\nAt the time of writing, daily shows have not been tested at all.\r\n\r\n### Specials / Miniseries\r\n\r\nWe need to create expressions for miniseries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n## Acknowledgments\r\n\r\nNodeTV utilises the following third-party data sources:\r\n\r\n- [TVShowsApp](http://tvshowsapp.com): Show list and RSS feeds\r\n- [Trakt.tv](http://trakt.tv): Show information, artwork and social functions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Licence\r\n\r\nThis software is distributed under a Modified BSD License.
